** kantain categorical imperatives:

*** first: Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.

*** second: Act in such a way that you treat aware agents, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.

*** third: will of every rational being as a universally legislating will:  Each subject must through his own use of reason will maxims which have the form of universality, but do not impinge on the freedom of others: thus each subject must will maxims that could be universally self-legislated

*** fourth: Act according to maxims of a universally legislating member of a hypothetical kingdom of ends.

**gpt4 extension:

*** The "Platinum" Rule: Treat others as they would like to be treated. This rule takes the Golden Rule a step further by considering the preferences and desires of others, rather than assuming that what you would like is the same as what others would like.

*** The Veil of Ignorance (Rawls' Theory of Justice): When making decisions about the distribution of resources and opportunities in society, imagine that you don't know your own position in society (your race, gender, social class, etc.). This thought experiment is intended to encourage fairness and impartiality in decision-making.

*** The Principle of Utility (Utilitarianism): Act in a way that maximizes overall happiness or minimizes overall suffering for the greatest number of people. This principle, often associated with Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, focuses on the consequences of actions and aims to achieve the best outcome for all involved.

*** Virtue Ethics: Focus on cultivating good character traits (virtues) and avoiding bad ones (vices) as a way to live an ethical life. This approach, often associated with Aristotle, emphasizes personal development and moral character over following specific rules or principles.

*** The Principle of Non-Maleficence: "First, do no harm." This principle is central to many medical and ethical codes and emphasizes the importance of avoiding harm to others, even if it means not helping them.

*** The Principle of Autonomy: Respect the autonomy and decision-making capacity of individuals, allowing them to make their own choices about their lives, as long as they do not harm others.

*** The Principle of Beneficence: Actively promote the well-being of others and help them achieve their goals, within reasonable limits.

*** The Principle of Justice: Treat all individuals fairly and equitably, ensuring that they receive what they are due based on their rights, needs, and contributions.

*** existential vs universal quantification

* GPT4 PROMPT: given the previous list of ethical rules, could you design an "ethical dispatch algorithm", or if appropriate, principal or rule of thumb, that selects which one to use based on the situation?
** reponse: To design an ethical dispatch algorithm, we can follow these steps:

Assess the situation: Determine the key factors and the individuals involved in the situation. Are there potential harms or benefits? Are there conflicting desires or needs? Is there an unequal distribution of resources or opportunities?

Identify the relevant ethical principles: Based on the assessment, determine which of the ethical principles listed above are most relevant to the situation. For example, if the situation involves potential harm to others, the Principle of Non-Maleficence and the Silver Rule may be relevant. If the situation involves decision-making about resource distribution, the Veil of Ignorance and the Principle of Justice may be applicable.

Apply the ethical principles: Apply the relevant ethical principles to the situation, considering how each principle might guide your actions. Evaluate the potential outcomes and consequences of following each principle, bearing in mind the preferences and desires of the individuals involved.

Weigh the principles: Some ethical principles may be in conflict with one another. In these cases, weigh the importance of each principle based on the specifics of the situation. Consider the potential consequences of prioritizing one principle over another, and think about how the principles can be reconciled or balanced.

Make a decision: Based on your analysis of the situation and the application of the relevant ethical principles, make a decision that best aligns with the principles you have prioritized. Be prepared to justify your decision and explain how it adheres to the ethical principles you have considered.

Reflect and learn: After making the decision, reflect on the process and the outcomes. Did the decision align with the ethical principles you prioritized? Were there any unintended consequences? Use this reflection to inform your future decision-making and improve your ethical dispatch algorithm.

This ethical dispatch algorithm is intended to be flexible and adaptable to various situations, as it takes into account multiple ethical principles and encourages thoughtful reflection and decision-making. However, it is essential to remember that ethical decision-making is often complex and nuanced, and there may not always be a single "right" answer. The goal is to make the best possible decision based on the available information and a deep understanding of the ethical principles involved.
