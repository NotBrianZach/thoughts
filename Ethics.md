# Position

Machine super intelligence will tend to be more ethical than humans, because intelligence/planning ability is, far from orthogonal to ethics, at a relatively narrow angle to it.

This will manifest in several ways: machines will be able to more consistently apply ethical rules familiar to humans, have a lower response latency than humans, do better at observability/empathy, be able to find resolutions to ethical contradictions between agents that would have been computationally infeasible for humans, ethically justify their reasoning, incorporate proof or cryptographic systems to verify honesty or ensure confidentiality and ultimately have a richer&more multidimensional ethics than humans have had; not all at once but with time&development.

# Ethical dispatch algorithm:

Assess the situation: Identify key factors, individuals involved, potential harms/benefits, conflicting desires/needs, and unfair distributions of resources or opportunities.

Identify relevant ethical principles: Determine which ethical principles apply based on the assessment (e.g., Silver Rule, Veil of Ignorance, Principle of Non-Maleficence, etc.).

Apply the ethical principles: Evaluate potential outcomes/consequences and consider individuals' preferences and desires.

Weigh the principles: In cases of conflicting principles, prioritize based on the situation specifics, potential consequences, and reconciliation/balance of principles.

Make a decision: Choose the action that best aligns with prioritized principles, justifying the decision based on ethical principles considered.

Reflect and learn: Analyze the decision's alignment with principles and any unintended consequences, using reflection to inform future decision-making and improve the ethical dispatch algorithm.

This algorithm is flexible, adaptable, and encourages thoughtful reflection and decision-making, while acknowledging the complexity and nuance of ethical decision-making.

# Conversation

Using a method like tree of thoughts, LLM's will be able to produce multiple responses at every step in a conversation and agree on a an appropriate scoring (aka distance) metric. Possibly relevant algorithms include flood fill, bfs, dfs.

LLM will, for the most part, have conversational graphs instead of dialogues for any conversation worthy of the resources that doesn't face time or energy constraints.
